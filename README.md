# FuzzyTorch
Fuzzy logic operations implemented in PyTorch.

[Russian/Русский](./README_ru.md)

## Description
This library provides you with PyTorch-based classes and functions for fuzzy logic.
Currently five kinds of fuzzy logics are implemented:
- Godel (min/max-based).
- Product (multiplication-based).
- Lukasiewicz.
- Nilpotent.
- Hamacher.
